# Constructive Developmental Theory, Immunity to Change

## Constructive Developmental Framework

> * Stage 1: Purely impulse or reflex-driven (infancy and early childhood).
> * Stage 2: The person's sense of self is ruled by their needs and wishes. The needs and wishes of others are relevant only to the extent that they support those of the person. Effectively the person and others inhabit two "separate worlds" (childhood to adolescence).
> * Stage 3: The person's sense of self is socially determined, based on the real or imagined expectations of others (post-adolescence).
> * Stage 4: The person's sense of self is determined by a set of values that they have authored for themselves (rarely achieved, only in adulthood).
> * Stage 5: The person's sense of self is no longer bound to any particular aspect of themselves or their history, and they are free to allow themselves to focus on the flow of their lives.

  > Psychologically, people grow through stages of increasing competence, care, and concern. Each stage transcends and includes the function of what came before, but excludes an exclusive identity with that function.

## Subject-Object Relations

  > Understanding that which holds us back, and how to break free. This is at the core of personal change, no matter what you want to change. We often face situations where we are unable to make the major change in our lives or at work we so desperately want. This episode is based on the concept of Subject-Object relations stemming from the work of Dr. Robert Kegan. This is about what it means to help people see a bigger world, to better understand themselves, to change their behavior, and to make better decisions. Do away with self-defeating behaviors, and getting rid of limiting beliefs. It’s time to succeed.

## Organizational Development

  > Robert Kegan and Lisa Lahey [...] along with Matthew L. Miller, Andy Fleming, and Deborah Helsing, provide a new model that they argue can help organizations develop the potential of their employees. An Everyone Culture examines the design principles of three leading companies that embody this approach—companies the authors call Deliberately Developmental Organizations (DDOs)—all of which operate under the conviction that organizations are most likely to prosper when they are deeply aligned with one of their workers’ strongest motives: to grow.

## Immunity to Change

* [The Real Reason People Won’t Change](https://hbr.org/2001/11/the-real-reason-people-wont-change) by Robert Kegan	and Lisa Lahey 
  > Every manager is familiar with the employee who just won’t change. Sometimes it’s easy to see why—the employee fears a shift in power, the need to learn new skills, the stress of having to join a new team. In other cases, such resistance is far more puzzling. An employee has the skills and smarts to make a change with ease, has shown a deep commitment to the company, genuinely supports the change—and yet, inexplicably, does nothing.
