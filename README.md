## Constructive Developmental Framework

[Constructive Developmental Framework: Stages of Adult Development - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_developmental_framework#Stages_of_adult_development)
> * Stage 1: Purely impulse or reflex-driven (infancy and early childhood).
> * Stage 2: The person's sense of self is ruled by their needs and wishes. The needs and wishes of others are relevant only to the extent that they support those of the person. Effectively the person and others inhabit two "separate worlds" (childhood to adolescence).
> * Stage 3: The person's sense of self is socially determined, based on the real or imagined expectations of others (post-adolescence).
> * Stage 4: The person's sense of self is determined by a set of values that they have authored for themselves (rarely achieved, only in adulthood).
> * Stage 5: The person's sense of self is no longer bound to any particular aspect of themselves or their history, and they are free to allow themselves to focus on the flow of their lives.

* [The Evolving Self](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674272316), Robert Kegan - Problem and Process in Human Development
  > The Evolving Self focuses upon the most basic and universal of psychological problems—the individual’s effort to make sense of experience, to make meaning of life. According to Robert Kegan, meaning-making is a lifelong activity that begins in earliest infancy and continues to evolve through a series of stages encompassing childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. The Evolving Self describes this process of evolution in rich and human detail, concentrating especially on the internal experience of growth and transition, its costs and disruptions as well as its triumphs.
  > 
  > At the heart of our meaning-making activity, the book suggests, is the drawing and redrawing of the distinction between self and other. Using Piagetian theory in a creative new way to make sense of how we make sense of ourselves, Kegan shows that each meaning-making stage is a new solution to the lifelong tension between the universal human yearning to be connected, attached, and included, on the one hand, and to be distinct, independent, and autonomous on the other.

| Evolutionary balance | Culture of embeddedness |
| --- | --- |
| (0) Incorporative S: reflexes, sensing, and moving O: nothing | Mothering culture. Mothering one(s) or primary caretaker(s).  |
| (1) Impulsive S: impulse and perception O: reflexes, sensing, and moving | Parenting culture. Typically, the family triangle.  |
| (2) Imperial S: enduring disposition, needs, interests, wishes O: impulse and perception | Role-recognizing culture. School and family as institutions of authority and role differentiation. Peer gang which requires role-taking. | 
| (3) Interpersonal S: mutuality, interpersonal concordance O: enduring disposition, needs, interests, wishes | Culture of mutuality. Mutually reciprocal one-to-one relationships.  |
| (4) Institutional S: personal autonomy, self-system identity O: mutuality, interpersonal concordance | Culture of identity or self-authorship (in love or work). Typically: group involvement in career, admission to public arena.  |
| (5) Interindividual S: interpenetration of systems O: personal autonomy, self-system identity | Culture of intimacy (in love and work). Typically: genuinely adult love relationship. |

* [In Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674445888)
  > In Over Our Heads provides us entirely fresh perspectives on a number of cultural controversies—the “abstinence vs. safe sex” debate, the diversity movement, communication across genders, the meaning of postmodernism. What emerges in these pages is a theory of evolving ways of knowing that allows us to view adult development much as we view child development, as an open-ended process born of the dynamic interaction of cultural demands and emerging mental capabilities. If our culture is to be a good “school,” as Kegan suggests, it must offer, along with a challenging curriculum, the guidance and support that we clearly need to master this course—a need that this lucid and richly argued book begins to meet.

His insights are fascinating and help him identify behaviors that are not aligned with an Agile mindset, and how to help his clients move in the correct development direction.  William is speaking not from theory, but from practical application within clients in the US, China and Mexico.

  > The study of social systems has increasingly relied on data collection and analysis to draw conclusions. In parallel, the research community has often tried to understand entrepreneurs quantitatively, e.g. by understanding which behaviours or personality traits most often correlated with entrepreneurial success. While a quantified representation is essential in modeling what is being studied, it hides away the mental processes that create behaviours. Arguably, the people who engage the most directly with systemic change are entrepreneurs. They have to create their own system (a company) and connect it to its wider network (clients, investors, etc.). Most importantly, the more uncommon their idea is, the less they can rely on existing frames to bring their ideas to fruition, and the more they have to reflect on the dynamics of their wider context and how their company can integrate to it.

## Dialectical Thought Form Framework

* [Adult Development by Otto Laske](https://nxtstg.org/2019/05/16/adult-develoment-by-otto-laske/)
  > Otto is internationally known as a teacher and mentor of evidence-based developmental coaching. Since 2000, he has educated an international student body in a methodology of social- emotional and cognitive coaching called CDF (Constructive Developmental Framework) at the Interdevelopmental Institute, Gloucester, MA, USA. He has successfully worked with teams since 2015, especially teams on their way to self-organization.

  > I am introducing into Dialectical Critical Realism (DCR) a developmental, dialogical,and dialectical epistemology for enhancing adults’ cognitive development toward dialectic. I do so for the sake of solving real-world problems in a holistic and transformational manner with a high likelihood of success.

  > Technologically driven culture change, impoverishment of undergraduate and graduate education due to a focus on obtaining employment, and the growth of global risks of human survival in the context of the depletion of nature increasingly put an unforeseen emphasis on human dialog and thinking. They also make seemingly “academic” investigations into the cognitive development of adults (on which quality of thinking and dialog depend) pragmatically relevant with unforeseen urgency. This introduction to the Dialectical Thought Form Framework (DTF) by way of an introduction to theManual of dialectical thought forms (DTFM; Laske 2008),while delving into the intricacies of the thought form structure of thinking and its assessment, was primarily conceived as a tool for making dialectical thinking better known, as well as a tool for designing programs for teaching it, beginning in high school.


## Subject-Object Relations

> The psychological idea is that the underlying architecture or transformational grammar of qualitative change (genuinely [negentropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negentropy) development) is the movement from subject to object-that is, the movement of our meaning making from a place where we are its captive to a place where we can look at it, reexamine it, and possibly alter it. - [*the Way We Talk Can Change the Way We Work*](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/01/01/how-way-we-talk-can-change-way-we-work)

* [The Psychology of Leadership and Success, Fears and Obstacles](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/psychology-leadership-success-fears-obstacles/id1433800594?i=1000418464268) - The Leader Development Podcast
  > The idea of subject object transition which is a focus of Dr. Robert Kegan a psychologist and professor at Harvard University. He stresses that not only can we not hold onto certain understandings of ourselves and the world, but in a way certain things hold us. We are almost literally subjected to these distortions of reality.  
* [USING THE SUBJECT-OBJECT INTERVIEW TO PROMOTE AND ASSESS SELF-AUTHORSHIP](https://www.cultivatingleadership.co.nz/site/uploads/Berger-Chapter-14-Prepublication-Draft-1.pdf), Jennifer Garvey Berger, Ed D
  > The process of growth as defined by this theory is about moving more and more of what is unseen and unexamined in the way we understand the world—those things to which we are subject —to a place where they can be seen and examined—and become objects for our inspection, and, if we chose, for our reflective action. Our unquestioned beliefs about the world are held implicitly, and those beliefs shape our experience of the world and the possibilities we perceive. As we begin to question our beliefs, ideas, theories, etc., our inquiry reveals new possibilities and allows us to deal with greater and greater levels of complexity.
  > 
  > The most profound example of a move from subject to object is when gradually, over time, entire meaning-making systems move from being hidden (subject) to being seen (object). 
* [Epistemology, Fourth Order Consciousness, and the Subject-Object Relationship or... How the Self Evolves with Robert Kegan](http://image.jesuits.org/OIS/media/171026%20Epistemology%20and%20the%20Fourth%20Order%20of%20Consciousness.pdf) by Elizabeth Debold (What is Enlightenment Magazine) 
  > So what is the "subject-object relationship"? It is a fundamental distinction in the way that we make sense of our experience—a distinction that shapes our thinking, our feeling, our social relating, and our ways of relating to internal aspects of ourselves. The subject-object relationship is not just an abstraction but a living thing in nature. 
  >
  > What I mean by "**object**" are those aspects of our experience that are apparent to us and can be looked at, related to, reflected upon, engaged, controlled, and connected to something else. We can be objective about these things, in that we don't see them as "me." But other aspects of our experience we are so identified with, embedded in, fused with, that we just experience them as ourselves. This is what we experience subjectively—the "**subject**" half of the subject-object relationship. 
  > 
  > What gradually happens is not just a linear accretion of more and more that one can look at or think about, but a qualitative shift in the very shape of the window or lens through which one looks at the world. *A given subject-object relationship establishes the shape of the window*. Thus, *for a certain period of time, a particular distinction between what is object and what is subject persists. Then you know the world through that system, and while your knowing gets increasingly elaborated, it all goes on within the terms of that system*. 
  >
  > So, for example, when you get to be what we call a "concrete thinker," usually between the ages of six and ten, you are able to learn facts, more and more facts, but you're still just learning the facts. Children at this age and stage collect baseball cards, bugs, leaves from trees—they come to understand the world around them by identifying, naming, and labeling the objects in it. 
  >
  > But you have to make a qualitative move to transform the subject-object relationship before you are able to organize these facts into bigger abstract ideas, themes, and values. This, then, becomes the next epistemology. Each qualitative move takes a whole mental structure that had been experienced as subject and shifts it so that it becomes seen as object.

  > Robert Kegan and Lisa Lahey [...] along with Matthew L. Miller, Andy Fleming, and Deborah Helsing, provide a new model that they argue can help organizations develop the potential of their employees. An Everyone Culture examines the design principles of three leading companies that embody this approach—companies the authors call Deliberately Developmental Organizations (DDOs)—all of which operate under the conviction that organizations are most likely to prosper when they are deeply aligned with one of their workers’ strongest motives: to grow.

  >
  > In an ordinary organization, most people are doing a second job no one is paying them for. In businesses large and small; in government agencies, schools, and hospitals; in for-profits and nonprofits, and in any country in the world, most people are spending time and energy covering up their weaknesses, managing other people’s impressions of them, showing themselves to their best advantage, playing politics, hiding their inadequacies, hiding their uncertainties, hiding their limitations.

* [Changing on the Job: Developing Leaders for a Complex World](https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Job-Developing-Leaders-Complex/dp/0804786968/)
  > Listen to people in every field and you'll hear a call for more sophisticated leadership—for leaders who can solve more complex problems than the human race has ever faced. But these leaders won't simply come to the fore; we have to develop them, and we must cultivate them as quickly as is humanly possible. Changing on the Job is a means to this end. As opposed to showing readers how to play the role of a leader in a "paint by numbers" fashion, Changing on the Job builds on theories of adult growth and development to help readers become more thoughtful individuals, capable of leading in any scenario. Moving from the theoretical to the practical, and employing real-world examples, author Jennifer Garvey Berger offers a set of building blocks to help cultivate an agile workforce while improving performance. Coaches, HR professionals, thoughtful leaders, and anyone who wants to flourish on the job will find this book a vital resource for developing their own capacities and those of the talent that they support.

## Immunity to Change

* [HarvardX - edX - ImmunityToChange.pdf](https://courses.edx.org/c4x/HarvardX/GSE1x/asset/ImmunityToChange.pdf)
  > Since its 2009 publication, Immunity to Change: How to Overcome It and Unlock the Potential in Yourself and Your Organization, by Robert Kegan and Lisa Laskow Lahey, has changed the lives of individuals and organizations across the globe. The enclosed excerpts—selected as required reading for this course—are pulled directly from this powerful and provocative book.
  > In Immunity to Change, the authors show how our individual beliefs combined with the collective mind-sets in our organizations create a natural and commanding immunity to change. By explaining how this mechanism holds us back, Kegan and Lahey give us the keys to unlock our potential and finally move forward. And by pinpointing and uprooting our own immunities to change, we can bring our organizations forward with us.
  > In addition to the enclosed readings, the full book includes hands-on assessments, tools, and compelling case studies to help all of us overcome forces of inertia to transform work and life.

  > Kegan and Lahey's technology helps us see that, for every unrealized commitment to change we genuinely hold and act out of, we also have a conflicting and harder-to-recognize commitment that prevents the very change we desire. A CEO, for example, may hold a genuine commitment to empowering her employees and fostering more collaboration in her organization. She may even take steps to distribute leadership, designate staff responsibilities, and provide professional development to enhance individual employees' abilities to assume new duties. But, at the same time, a part of her remains tacitly committed to maintaining control, or to feeling indispensible, or to preserving past loyalties. Subtly or overtly, she undermines her new initiatives by behavioring in service to these hidden commitments. These conflicting commitments create a dynamic equilibrium--her own version of an immune system--preventing real and lasting change. How can she overcome this immune system? And, if she succeeds, how might her organization overcome its own immune system?
* [The Real Reason People Won’t Change](https://hbr.org/2001/11/the-real-reason-people-wont-change) by Robert Kegan	and Lisa Lahey 
  > Every manager is familiar with the employee who just won’t change. Sometimes it’s easy to see why—the employee fears a shift in power, the need to learn new skills, the stress of having to join a new team. In other cases, such resistance is far more puzzling. An employee has the skills and smarts to make a change with ease, has shown a deep commitment to the company, genuinely supports the change—and yet, inexplicably, does nothing.

  > Drawing from the work of Lisa Lahey and Robert Kegan, Henry Dittmer shares his experience using the Immunity to Change (ITC) map to help participants of his session identify what is keeping them from achieving a desired change. Dittmer used the four-step ITC map to demonstrate why - paradoxically - he doesn't like presenting at conferences. The four steps are:
  > 
  > 1. What One Big Thing do you want to commit to changing?
  > 2. What are you doing or not doing that's keeping you from doing this thing?
  > 3. What worries and fears (hidden competing commitments) arise when you think about doing this thing?
  > 4. What assumptions make these commitments real for you?

  > Tami Simon speaks with Lisa about the inherent difficulty of making large personal changes—especially when they are essential to the advancement of your career. They talk about the inherent human resistance to change and the need to be fully aware of our "inner landscapes." Lisa explains how much of our resistance to change is rooted in self-protective patterns that need to be reckoned with before we can move forward. Tami and Lisa also discuss how to cultivate skills such as time management and communication, as well as what we can do to regulate work-based anxiety. Finally, Lisa details the three evolutionary steps for creating meaning and shares her hopes for the Inner MBA program.(67 minutes)

The Leaders Lyceum strives to help all leaders identify and leverage their real-time/real-world challenges and then create the space, structure, and teaching that allows those challenges to fuel the kind of growth we have presented in The Map—growth that can lead to greater effectiveness in leadership, life, and legacy.
  > 
  > Real growth happens when people have a chance to take what they’ve learned and immediately apply it to their lives. Our flagship program, Elevated Leadership, involves 5 session days that take place on a 6-week interval with 2-week touch points between sessions. Through both large group learning and intentional dialog in Cross Mentoring Groups, we provide the structure and accountability necessary for learning and growth. The program also includes various exercises and assessments to help participants come to a deeper understanding of themselves, both their strengths and their opportunities for growth. This unique approach accelerates Vertical development, resulting in meaningful impact and lasting leader growth.

* [Unlocking Leadership Mindtraps](https://www.cultivatingleadership.co.nz/books/unlocking-leadership-mindtraps), Jennifer Garvey Berger - How to thrive in complexity
  > Using her background in adult development, complexity theories, and leadership consultancy, Garvey Berger discerns five pernicious and pervasive “mind traps” to frame the book. 
  > - the desire for simple stories
  > - our sense that we are right
  > - our desire to get along with others in our group
  > - our fixation with control
  > - our constant quest to protect and defend our egos.
  >
  > In addition to understanding why these natural impulses steer us wrong in a fast-moving world, leaders will get powerful questions and approaches that help them escape these patterns.
* [Simple Habits for Complex Times](https://www.cultivatingleadership.co.nz/books/simplehabitsforcomplextimes), Jennifer Garvey Berger and Keith Johnston - Powerful practices for leaders
  > Simple Habits for Complex Times provides three integral practices that enable leaders to navigate the unknown. By taking multiple perspectives, asking different questions, and seeing more of their system, leaders can better understand themselves, their roles, and the world around them. 
* [Changing on the Job](https://www.cultivatingleadership.co.nz/books/changingonthejob), Jennifer Garvey Berger - Developing leaders for a complex world
  > [Summary](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/548309/summary): Our roles as higher education professionals require complex leadership capacities— capacities that enable us to make decisions amidst competing perspectives, establish priorities among multiple commitments, and maintain partnerships despite conflict or resistance. In Changing on the Job: Developing Leaders for a Complex World, Berger explains that gaining such capacities is not simply a matter of gaining new skills or using different styles but rather involves developmental growth by which leaders cultivate increasingly broader, more complex ways of making meaning. Drawing upon her expertise in Kegan’s (1982, 1994) theory of self-evolution and her experiences as a leadership development consultant, Berger provides an accessible yet rich resource for fostering one’s own growth and the growth of others as leaders. While Changing on the Job is applicable to a wide variety of learning contexts and educational roles, it is most directly relevant for professional development purposes and supervisory or mentorship roles. Ultimately, Berger highlights the importance of cultivating complex leadership capacities within ourselves and our professional communities as well as among our students.
* [Why Purpose Matters](https://www.cultivatingleadership.co.nz/books/why-purpose-matters), Nicholas Barnett and Rodney Howard - And How it Can Transform Your Organisation
  > In Why Purpose Matters, Rodney Howard and co-author, Nicholas Barnett, explain how organisations can discover their purpose and then through an authentic and sustained leadership commitment, embed it in their culture and make it their new way of organisational life.
  > 
  > Ultimately, this book is about transformation that shapes a whole new organisational identity from the inside out and adds new focus and energy to employee endeavours.
* [Choose Your Stories](https://www.cultivatingleadership.co.nz/books/choose-your-stories) - John Sautelle
  > Drawing on the latest research in psychology, neuroscience, adult development theory and 20 years’ experience as an executive coach, Sautelle helps leaders use their “embodied wisdom” to surface and rewrite fear-based stories, freeing them to make the changes they want to make. Through rich case studies which explore Purpose, Identity, and Values stories we inherit, adopt, create and sometimes disown, in Choose Your Stories, Change Your Life Sautelle brings this change process to life.

    > Jennifer Garvey Berger writes in her new book Unlocking Leadership Mindtraps about unhelpful patterns of behavior that we fall into without noticing that we’ve fallen into them. These are behaviors that treat the uncertainty, ambiguity, and change around us as though the world were more understandable, more predictable, and more constant than it is. Discover some of the counterintuitive ways we can act that would be much more helpful, given the complexity and dynamism of the world.

  > Jordan Peterson has gone from an obscure Canadian academic to an intellectual megastar in a little over a year, and become one of the most polarising cultural figures. At the core, his philosophical project involves tying together mythology, religion and science into a 'theory of everything' that many are finding compelling. The Integral philosopher Ken Wilber did something similar in the 90s and 2000s, and built a large and passionate following. What does he make of Jordan Peterson's rise to fame? Where does he agree, and disagree with his philosophy?
